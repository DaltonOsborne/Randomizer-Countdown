Randomizer-Countdown
This app is a pokemon movie randomizer with a countdown timer to the new pokemon game, which shows how many days until the game comes out. My features are that I have a list of pokemon movies populated with extra data, and my randomizer retrieves one of my movies from a list and uses it. I pull from my media class from my movies class to get directors and my date times for the movies and directors which should work for creating an additional class and inheriting from it, and then my countdown timer, which calculates and displays data which is my last requirement!
